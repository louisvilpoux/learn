# Practice and Learn :
This repositery is about test, pratice and learn. 

## Notebook `feedforward_nn_manual_tensorflow.ipynb` :
The goal is to manually create a 1-layer neural network using Tensorflow basic operations (placeholders, matrix multiplication, variables, ...).

Architecture : 

Data : Titanic (from Kaggle).

## Notebook `handwritten_reco_dense.ipynb` :
The goal is to predict images of handwritten digits using Dense layers. This means that the fact of using images as data has not been used (a ConvNet should probably best perform in that case).

Architecture : 

Data : Mnist dataset

## Notebook `handwritten_reco_cnn.ipynb` :
The goal is to predict images of handwritten digits using a Convoution Neural Network.

Architecture : 

Data : Mnist dataset
